## Important notice:

You'll get an error if you don't run this code on some sort of a server. To run it properly do this:
- download the code
- open it on VSCode
- run the 'Live Server' extension

A good tutorial is [here](https://youtu.be/wD4mR7f2YIk?t=92)

## Prerequisites:
- VSCode
- VSCode Live Server Extension

## Final Note:
I'll try to fix my code to allow you not to have to do that in the near future. But for now, this is the best I could currently do.
